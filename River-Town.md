### Summary in three sentences<a id="sec-2-1-1"></a>

The author, Peter Hessler, came to the small Chinese town Fuling in 1996 with another volunteer called Adam Meier. They were sent by Peace Corps from America, to work there as English teacher. They would spent next 2 years in Fuling.

Few days after they arrived, they have witnessed an assembly for the sixtieth anniversary of Long March. The assembly was to welcome the participants, who marched over a thousand miles, from Fuling to Yan'an for the anniversary event. Peter and Adam were introduced to the students at this assembly 'in a mad rush of applause', which made them at the same time very embarrassed, partly because of the casual clothing they had on. This scene assembles the awkwardness and unfitness in the very early days of their first presence in this remote environment.

They observed the daily routines of the school and tried to fit into it. The most interesting part is that, Adam found it the best way was to learn something from the students' journals. They would see themselves from the eyes of students. They would also get to know how to appreciate the point of views and stories of the students. This is the most touching part of this chapter. The author was moved by the genuine narratives from the students' perspectives, how they felt about their parent generation, the land and the country. Nonetheless, he also kept his distance with a skeptical tone, trying to find some reason behind these very different views for the students.

### Quotes<a id="sec-2-1-2"></a>

> My student had difficulty criticising anything Chinese, and this was not surprising, because they were constantly being indoctrinated by the Communist Party.

> I sensed that I simply couldn't judge the students for anything they thought, at least in the beginning. Their backgrounds were too far removed from what I had known before coming to Fuling, and , like all young Chinese, they were surrounded by the aura of a troubled past.

> It was hard for me to imagine a better job. My students were eager and respectful, and they were bright.
